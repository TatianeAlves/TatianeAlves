## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you're here, it means you found me on some other social network and are curious to learn a bit more about my background and what I've been up to in my career as a data scientist and lifelong learner. So, here we go!

:woman_technologist: I have a degree in Information Systems and a postgraduate degree in Data Science.
- In the early stages of my career, I worked in web and systems development, which helped me build strong developer skills, along with an understanding of all the memes that come with the field!
- I spent a few years working on implementing CRM Cloud projects using tools like Oracle and Salesforce. Beyond the technical skills gained from this experience, I learned a lot about how to work with different people in various contexts and that everyone always has something to teach and something to learn.
- Since transitioning to my current role, Iâ€™ve been working as a data scientist, continuously evolving to stay up to date, while never forgetting the foundational techniques in this amazing field.

Now, if you'd like to know a little more about me personally, hereâ€™s a glimpse:

- :black_cat: :cat2: I'm a proud pet mom and have a very close relationship with my family;
- :books: I love reading and painting. I read everything, from classics to manga. What Iâ€™m reading at any given moment really depends on my mood. If you enjoy reading too, feel free to check out my Skoob profile.
- :swimming_woman: I love movement. I enjoy dancing, have practiced martial arts, and am currently focused on swimming.
- :speech_balloon: I struggled with learning English early in my life but have come to appreciate the beauty of learning new languages.
- :guitar: I try to play the guitar, but to be honest, I have a long way to go before I'm any good!

Welcome to my profile! I hope you find something new here that you didnâ€™t know before. And please, leave something new for me too, something I don't know yet, so I can keep improving!
